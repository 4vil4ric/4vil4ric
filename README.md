## Hi there 👋
2025学习记录

20250101
今年准备用github记录一下这一年的学习记录，自学最容易懈怠，目前感兴趣的有英文、西语、漏洞挖掘、AI相关、健身；

还是要多阅读，阅读是学习别人的逻辑和行事方法，比自己独立思考要来的快；

The world’s wondrous, beautiful, and extraordinary sights are often dangerous and distant, therefore rarely visited, and only by the determined.

When all is said and done, much more is said than done.--David Cutler
