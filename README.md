## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
2025 Learning Log

20250101
This year, I plan to use GitHub to document my learning progress. Self-study is prone to procrastination, so I need to stay disciplined. My current interests include English, Spanish, vulnerability research, AI-related topics, and fitness.

I should also read more. Reading helps me learn from others' logic and approaches, which is faster than relying solely on my own independent thinking.

The worldâ€™s wondrous, beautiful, and extraordinary sights are often dangerous and distant, therefore rarely visited, and only by the determined.

When all is said and done, much more is said than done.--David Cutler
